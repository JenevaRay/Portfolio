# Portfolio
## Description
React TypeScript Redux Portfolio Showcase using Github API
- I wanted a website to showcase my programming skills and knowledge so that people have an idea of what I can do.
- I built it to learn more of what I don't know!  In the process I got a solid handle on React+TypeScript+Redux, as well as the Github API.
- Why write a portfolio showcase twice, when written well once can be twice as nice?
- I learned React, Redux, TypeScript, and how to take GitHub API data to present my work in a visually dynamic way.
